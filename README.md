This project is a simple web tool that lets you analyze articles or blog posts by running Natural Language Processing (NLP) on them. By pasting a URL, the tool uses the Aylien API to figure out the article's sentiment (is it positive, negative, or neutral?) and whether the content is subjective (opinion-based) or objective (fact-based).

This project gives you a hands-on introduction to working with APIs, setting up development tools like Webpack, and building interactive web applications. Itâ€™s a great way to get a feel for real-world web development and how all the tools come together!
